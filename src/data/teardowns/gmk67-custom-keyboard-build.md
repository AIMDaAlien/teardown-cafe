## Why I Built This

After getting hooked on mechanical keyboards, I wanted to build my own from scratch. The GMK67 was perfect for a first build - hot-swappable switches, straightforward assembly, and room to experiment with different switch types.

**The vision:** A lavender-themed keyboard with linear switches for letters (smooth, fast typing) and tactile switches for modifiers (distinct feedback).

**Total cost:** ~$130

## The Build

**Components:**
- **Board:** GMK67 hot-swap PCB (65% layout)
- **Switches (Letters):** AKKO Lavender switches - Linear
- **Switches (Modifiers):** KTT Baby White switches - Tactile
- **Keycaps:** Lavender gradient PBT set
- **Acquired:** June 6, 2024

This is my second mechanical keyboard, but my first custom build from components.

## Build Process

### Step 1: Component Prep

Hot-swap PCBs are beginner-friendly - no soldering required. The board has clear switch socket guides, so you can't install switches backward unless you really try.

**Key decision:** Mixed switches for different key zones:
- **AKKO Lavender (Linear)** for alphanumeric keys - smooth typing experience
- **KTT Baby White (Tactile)** for modifiers - tactile bump helps identify function keys by feel

### Step 2: Switch Installation

Installing switches was straightforward:
1. Align switch pins with hot-swap sockets
2. Press firmly until switch clicks into place
3. Verify switch is flush with plate

**Pro tip:** The board itself guides proper orientation - just match the pins to the socket holes.

**First-time experience:** Perfect. Not a single bent pin, no switches installed incorrectly. If you can press buttons, you can build this keyboard.

### Step 3: Keycap Installation

*Watch the assembly process*

The lavender gradient keycaps complete the aesthetic. PBT material feels solid and won't develop shine from finger oils like ABS keycaps.

*Typing sound test with mixed switches*

**Typing experience:**
- **Lavender linear switches:** Buttery smooth actuation, no tactile bump. Perfect for fast typing without finger fatigue
- **Baby White tactile switches:** Clear tactile feedback on modifiers helps identify keys without looking
- **Keycap sound:** Deep, satisfying thock from PBT material

**Why mixed switches work:**
- Letters see constant use - linear reduces finger strain
- Modifiers need distinction - tactile bump prevents accidental presses
- Sound variety adds character to typing

## Difficulty Assessment

**Rating: Easy**

**Why it's genuinely easy:**
- **No soldering:** Hot-swap PCB eliminates the biggest barrier to entry
- **Clear orientation:** Board guides prevent mistakes
- **No tools required:** Just your hands
- **Forgiving design:** Switches can be removed/repositioned if needed

**Time investment:**
- Unboxing and prep: 10 minutes
- Switch installation: 20 minutes
- Keycap installation: 10 minutes
- **Total:** ~40 minutes

**Skills needed:**
- Ability to press small components firmly
- That's it

**Perfect first build:** If you're considering custom keyboards but intimidated by complexity, this is your entry point.

**Repairability Score: 10/10**
- Hot-swap design = instant switch replacement
- No soldering = no permanent modifications
- Every component is user-replaceable
- Keycaps pop on/off in seconds

## Would I Recommend This Build?

**Absolutely yes, especially if:**
- First custom keyboard build
- Want to experiment with different switches
- Like the 65% compact layout (arrow keys + some function keys)
- Prefer smooth linear switches for typing

**Budget breakdown (~$130 total):**
- GMK67 PCB kit: ~$50
- AKKO Lavender switches (70): ~$25
- KTT Baby White switches (20): ~$10
- Lavender gradient PBT keycaps: ~$35
- USB cable: ~$10

**The best part:** Hot-swap design means I can swap switches anytime. Want clickier switches? Pop the old ones out, press new ones in. Done in 5 minutes.

This build proved custom keyboards aren't intimidating - they're just expensive LEGO sets that you type on.
