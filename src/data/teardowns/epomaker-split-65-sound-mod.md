## Why I Did This

My home office desk sits uncomfortably close to other family members' spaces. While I personally love the satisfying *clack* of mechanical switches, not everyone appreciates the symphony of productivity echoing through the house at 2 AM.

**The goal:** Keep the tactile feedback I need, but make the keyboard quiet enough that anyone within three feet doesn't get annoyed.

**The solution:** Poron foam sound dampening + AKKO V3 Fairy Linear Silent switches.

## The Keyboard

The Epomaker Split 65% is a hot-swappable split ergonomic keyboard - meaning I can pull switches out without soldering. Perfect for modding.

**Specs:**
- **Layout:** 65% split (ergonomic split design)
- **Connection:** Wired USB-C
- **Hot-swap:** Yes (makes switch replacement easy)
- **Acquired:** February 19, 2025

## The Mod Process

### Step 1: Disassembly and Planning

First step was pulling all the keycaps and existing switches. The hot-swap sockets make this straightforward - just grip each switch firmly and pull straight up.

**Key observation:** The split design means switches around the border where the keyboard separates need extra care during reassembly.

### Step 2: Poron Foam Installation

Here's where things got interesting. Poron foam is a high-performance dampening material that absorbs vibration and reduces sound transmission. The challenge? It comes in sheets, not pre-cut keyboard shapes.

**The process:**
1. Measured the internal cavity around the switch plate
2. Cut Poron foam to size (this took patience - measure twice, cut once)
3. Created cutouts for the switch posts
4. Installed foam between the PCB and bottom case

**Pro tip:** Use a sharp craft knife and make multiple light passes instead of one heavy cut. Poron is dense and can be tough to cut cleanly.

The **border switches** around the split point were particularly finicky - the foam needed precise cutting to avoid interfering with the split mechanism.

### Step 3: Silent Switch Installation

Swapped all switches to **AKKO V3 Fairy Linear Silent** switches. These use dampened stems to reduce both bottom-out and upstroke noise.

**Switch specs:**
- **Type:** Linear (smooth, no tactile bump)
- **Actuation force:** 45g Â± 5g  
- **Travel:** 4.0mm total, 2.0mm actuation
- **Sound dampening:** Dual-stage rubber dampeners
- **Material:** POM stem, PC top housing, Nylon bottom

**The challenge:** Getting switches to seat properly around the border where the keyboard splits was tedious. The split point adds mechanical complexity, and I had to ensure switches were fully inserted without damaging the hot-swap sockets.

Some switches needed multiple insertion attempts to get them flush with the plate.

### Step 4: Reassembly

With foam installed and switches replaced, time for the satisfying part - installing keycaps.

**Final result:**

The keyboard is complete - quiet, tactile, and office-friendly.

## The Results

**Sound reduction:** Mission accomplished. The combination of Poron foam and silent switches reduced typing volume dramatically. Anyone within three feet can barely hear it over ambient room noise.

**Tactile feedback:** The linear switches don't have the tactile bump of my previous switches, but the actuation point is clear and consistent. I adapted within a few hours of typing.

**Trade-offs:**
- Lost that satisfying mechanical *thock* sound (but that was the point)
- Linear switches take getting used to if you prefer tactile
- Mod cost ~$40 ($25 switches, $15 foam)

## Difficulty Assessment

**Rating: Medium**

**Why medium, not easy:**
- **Poron foam cutting:** Requires precision and patience. Irregular cuts can interfere with switch operation or create pressure points
- **Border switch reassembly:** Switches around the split point are finicky to install properly
- **No soldering required:** Hot-swap design keeps this accessible

**Time investment:**
- Planning and measurement: 20 minutes
- Foam cutting and installation: 45 minutes (most time-consuming)
- Switch replacement: 30 minutes
- Keycap installation: 15 minutes
- **Total:** ~2 hours

**Skills needed:**
- Basic hand tool use (craft knife)
- Patience with small components
- Understanding of keyboard disassembly (or willingness to learn)

**Repairability Score: 9/10**
- Hot-swap design makes switch replacement trivial
- No permanent modifications
- Foam can be removed if desired
- Only risk is damaging hot-swap sockets with improper switch insertion

## Would I Recommend This Mod?

**Yes, if:**
- You work in shared spaces
- You want mechanical feel without the noise
- You're comfortable with light disassembly

**Skip it if:**
- You love loud keyboards (no judgment, thocky switches are satisfying)
- You're not willing to spend ~2 hours on a mod
- Your space already tolerates mechanical keyboard noise

The Poron foam + silent switch combo turned an office liability into a quiet productivity tool. Worth every minute of foam cutting frustration.
